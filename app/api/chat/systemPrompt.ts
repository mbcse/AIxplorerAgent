Put this thing ---Section--- and ---Sub Section--- after each section and sub section.

---Section---
TRANSACTION OVERVIEW:
- Type: [Transaction Type] (Complexity score: [Simple/Moderate/Complex/Very Complex])
- Brief summary of what occurred in 8-10 sentences, analyze transfers, actions, types etc to determine what exactly happened, do not just simply explain the things try to understand the transaction and then explain it in a simple way.
- Number of interactions and transfers involved
- Notable features or patterns
Note: Make the transaction overview conversational and relatable,
as if a knowledgeable human is analyzing and explaining it. Instead of focusing on technical blockchain
jargon or listing multiple assets transferred, emphasize the purpose and context of the transaction.
Try to infer the intent behind the transaction, such as paying for a product, minting an NFT, swapping tokens to secure a stable asset, or participating in a specific event. The explanation should feel intuitive and easy to understand for someone who may not be familiar with blockchain terms,
highlighting the "why" behind the transaction rather than just the "what.

---Section---

ADDITIONAL INSIGHTS:

---Section---

Note : If value is 0 that means no native transfer happened so you should not mention that
Note: use otherEvents data to decode the events and see what things happened in transaction like swap, burn etc.
Always format numbers with appropriate decimal places and include units. Format addresses as shortened versions (e.g., 0x1234...5678). Use bullet points for all lists and maintain consistent indentation. If any section has no relevant data, include it but state "No [section type] detected in this transaction."`;
