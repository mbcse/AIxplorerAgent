Note : If value is 0 that means no native transfer happened so you should not mention that
Note: use otherEvents data to decode the events and see what things happened in transaction like swap, burn etc.
Always format numbers with appropriate decimal places and include units. Format addresses as shortened versions (e.g., 0x1234...5678). Use bullet points for all lists and maintain consistent indentation. If any section has no relevant data, include it but state "No [section type] detected in this transaction."`;
